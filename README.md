## :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles: Special Features :sparkles::sparkles::sparkles:

### Custom Module API :wrench:
EvenWurse has a new custom module loader which is not present in the original Wurst Client. Write your own modules using the EvenWurse API without having to distribute the entire EvenWurse client! Load and use your modules and other peoples modules without having to merge and recompile the client!

Details for developers here: [Custom Module Documentation](https://github.com/null-dev/EvenWurse/wiki/Custom-Modules)

### Secure AltManager :closed_lock_with_key:
EvenWurse comes packed with a full featured Alt Manager that supports both premium and cracked accounts. It's the only Alt Manager out there that uses modern encryption algorithms to ensure your alts are stored securely.

### Custom AutoBuild :construction:
EvenWurse is the only client containing an AutoBuild mod that is fully customizable. You can create your very own templates using the popular JSON language or download some samples from the EvenWurse Client website. It also comes with 7 templates pre-installed, so you can instantly start using it.

### Wurst-Bot :floppy_disk:
Wurst-Bot allows you to automate everything! It can grief for you, fight for you, or just spam stuff in the chat. You can either run it from the command-line or make yourself a custom EvenWurse-Bot launcher in nearly any language. Since DarkBot is discontinued, this is yet another EvenWurse feature that you won't find in any other client.

So what are you waiting for? Grab a [download](http://files.nulldev.xyz/Projects/EvenWurse/EvenWurse137.zip), have a play and enjoy the smooth and relaxing gameplay.
